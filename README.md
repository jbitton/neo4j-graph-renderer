# neo4j-graph-renderer

Since neo4j does not provide a way to render its graphs, this is a component that can be used in order to render a neo4j graph (with all the animations, etc).

## Usage

This is a react component that can be used throughout your project!

```npm install neo4j-graph-renderer```

Props you must provide:
* ```url```: the url required to access your neo4j db
* ```user```: the username required to access your neo4j db
* ```password```: the password required to access your neo4j db
* ```query```: the query you'd like to execute

& There you go! Your neo4j graph has been rendered!
